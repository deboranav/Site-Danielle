# Site-Danielle
This is a website I made for a friend who is going to participate in a selection from a company and needs a presentation web page. Here I used HTML5 and CSS3. :)
P.S.: 
*The images, links, and texts were modified, to protect her identity;
*The colors and pictures were chosen by her.
## This is the first view of the website
